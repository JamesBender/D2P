# D2P
## D2P Exports and knowledge base
This is a repository for the D2P Ultimate export files. All client exports shoud be added to this repository, and versioned as appropriate. 
### Structure
A fluent, consistent structure is key to make files and projects easily discoverable. To that end, it is requested that the following structue be adheared to when adding your project to this repository:
    
    root/
        Client Name (i.e. Armanino, Cirrus, Hoffmaster Group, etc.)/
            Vendor Name (i.e. Anthem, Discovery, Lincoln, etc.)/
                Project Number (i.e. TekP-2020-04-16-0001)/
                    all files
Before adding a new folder for a client or a vendor, please "pull" this repository to ensure that we do not end up with duplicats, and to help avoid merge issues due to name collision.
#### Special Folders
In the root of the repository is a folder called Starting Scripts. This contains the current 834 template, the current newformatcode Layout.xls file, and any full-export-file vendor specific templates that are available.

There *may* be multiple folders in the structue that contain various notes and code snippets. These are in the process of being moved to the Wiki. Please **do not** add or update any of these files; all new snippets and updates should be made to the Wiki.
Note: There are some older client/vendor/project folders that might not adhear to this structue. If you come accross one, please ensure that you are using the provided structure for your files (you may need to create/move files and folders for this) and notify the original owner so they can "clean-up" the folder when time permits.
### Pushing Changes
Unless otherwise instructed, you are feel to push your own new and updated files directly to the Master branch.

**IF** you are making updates to a file created by another author, please send a PR to that author so they are aware of the changes, which will help them save time if/when they take the file back over. If the original author is not currently on the D2P project, a PR is not necessary. You can (ad should) still send the export file through the normal process (to QA, re-test, production, etc.) without waiting for the PR to be reviewed and accepted.
