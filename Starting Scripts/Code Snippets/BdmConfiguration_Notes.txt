INSERT INTO dbo.U_dsi_bdm_Configuration VALUES (@FormatCode, 'NewEnrolleeType', '1')
1. Anyone newly enrolled in any deduction is valid
2. All new enrollees with no previous plan since their Date of Last Hire (eecDateOfLastHire)
3. All new enrollees with no previous plan in all history.
4. All new enrollees & re-enrollees with no active plan since their Date of Last Hire (eecDateOfLastHire). Re-enrollments into the same DedCode are
considered under this option. For example, the employee may have been enrolled in MED1 during his/her original employment and then was rehired at a later date and re-enrolled in MED1. NewEnrolleeType = '4' will consider this re-enrollment scenario as valid in the New Enrollee Module.
