From Cheryl:

For the 180 Record
Employee Name field (start position 22)
The vendor just noticed that the name field is not reporting the correct format.
He said that the name does not have a , or * separating the first and last names
The format should be Last*First I
I have updated the requirements for this field (see logic below) and added the document to the clients folder.
EepNameLast + '* ' + EepNameFirst + ' ' + Substring(EepNameMiddle,1,1)


The file is missing a Benefit Event Date for several employees on the file.
It looks like they may be rehires.
Can you please check the code to see if you are using the logic below?
See example employees
Tiana Nassrallah, Rosangelica Moran
The logic that should be used on the file is below.
Record 180
Field Benefit Event Date (start position 219)
if EecEmplStatus = T then EecDateOfTermination
Or
if eecemplstatus  = A and EecDateOfOriginalHire does not = EecDateOfLastHire send previous eecdateoftermination
Else Spaces
Format MM/DD/CCYY

I noticed the names on the 180 record do not have a , or * separating the first and last names.
